Java application letting users experiment with graph theory and Dijkstra's algorithm. This program allows for placing colorful nodes on the screen with automatically connecting lines/edges per 
successive node placed. Auxiliary edges are also randomly added such that there are multiple paths the algorithm can follow. Users are then prompted to input two nodes, a source and a destination 
node, that the algorithm will find the shorest path between. 
This project uses Java's Swing library for window management and graphics. 
Although this was my first introduction to the Swing library, I gained a plentitude of knowledge and see myself using it more effectively and smarter in the future.
